## Approach & Efficiency

The Graph class follows a straightforward approach and demonstrates efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
It employs an adjacency list representation to store vertices and their associated edges. The addition of vertices
and edges is achieved in constant time, making these operations highly efficient. Retrieving vertices and neighbors
has a time complexity proportional to the number of vertices and edges, respectively. The overall space complexity is
O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This implementation is particularly
well-suited for sparse graphs, where the number of edges is significantly less than the number of vertices,
resulting in a space-efficient representation. The provided methods fulfill the basic functionalities expected
in a graph data structure, making it a reliable and scalable solution for various graph-related operations.
