## Approach & Efficiency

The approach involves iterating through the array of city names representing the trip, checking for direct flights and accumulating the total cost.
The code achieves a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the trip array, as it iterates through each city in the trip. The space complexity
is O(1) as the function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

## Solution

![Output](../../../../../../assests/challenge%2037%20output.png)
After compiling, run the Java program using the java command followed by the class name and it will execute the main function that invoke the Graph class.
